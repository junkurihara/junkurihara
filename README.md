I am Jun Kurihara, working as a software engineer at a startup company and a researcher/lecturer at a university in Japan. I am really interested in developing novel security and networking products/services written in various languages on various infrastructures. You can reach me via my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/junkurihara/) or [WebSite](https://junkurihara.githu.io).

### Mutualized Oblivious DNS (Î¼ODNS)

Currently I am really interested in the enhancement of privacy-preserving DNS architectures. As one of my research activities, I am actively developing **Mutualized Oblivious DNS** by extending existing sophisticated encrypted and anonymized DNS protocols.

#### Concept paper (will be written)
> Jun Kurihara and Takeshi Kubo, "Mutualized oblivious DNS (Î¼ODNS): Hiding a tree in the wild forest," https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13785v3, Jun. 2021
#### Web page
> https://dns.secarchlab.net/

#### Server/Proxy/Client PoC implementations
##### Based on Oblivious DNS over HTTPS

- Server/Relay
  > https://github.com/junkurihara/doh-server
- Client:
  > https://github.com/junkurihara/doh-auth-proxy
- (Optional) Authentication server
  > https://github.com/junkurihara/rust-token-server

##### Based on DNSCrypt:

- Server/Relay:
  > https://github.com/junkurihara/encrypted-dns-server-modns
- Client:
  > https://github.com/junkurihara/dnscrypt-proxy-modns
- Experimental Resolvers based on DNSCrypt
