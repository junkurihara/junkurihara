### rpxy

`rpxy` [ahr-pik-see] is an implementation of simple and lightweight reverse-proxy with some additional features. The project is (always) work-in-progress, but being used in numbers of production environment. `rpxy` can handle the brand-new HTTP/3 connection, and supports ACME with TLS-ALPN-01 out-of-the-box.

### Mutualized Oblivious DNS (Î¼ODNS)

Currently I am really interested in the enhancement of privacy-preserving DNS architectures. As one of my research activities, I am actively developing **Mutualized Oblivious DNS** by extending existing sophisticated encrypted and anonymized DNS protocols.

#### Publications
